### Goal of the Game

### Game Play
The game starts when you, the user, clicks on the first card.  The game clock will start incrementing. When the second card is clicked, the program will determine if there is a match or not.  
- If the cards match, they will stay open and change colors
- If the cards do not match, they will turn face down once again and the user will be able to select two more cards. The game will continue until all cards are matched or the player hits the repeat button to start over.
At the conclusion of the game, a splash screen will show results. 

### Scoreboard
The game scoreboard includes 
- Running clock
- Card click counter
- Repeat icon to allow the user to start over
- Gold stars to indicate how good the user is doing
-- 0 to 25 card clicks = 3 stars
-- 26 to 40 card clicks = 2 stars
-- 41 to 50 card clicks = 1 star
-- Greater than 50 equals a single black star

## Game Dependencies
The game uses google API's for font's and bootstrap for the card icons.  So, the player should have internet connection for the best game play
