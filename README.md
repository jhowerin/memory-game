### Game Play
The game starts when you, the user, clicks on the first card.  The game clock will start incrementing. When the second card is clicked, the programm will determine if there is a match or not.  
- If the cards match, they will stay open and change colors
- If the cards do not match, they will turn face down once again and the user will be able to select two more cards. The game will continue until all cards are matched or the player hits the repeat button to start over.
At the conclusion of the game, a splash screen will show results.

- Running clock

- Gold stars to indicate how good the user is doing
-- 0 to 25 card clicks = 3 stars
